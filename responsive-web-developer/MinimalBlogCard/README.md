# MINIMAL BLOG CARD

[Link to style page](https://devchallenges.io/editor/solution/20192)

## Issues encountered
    - Card: 
        - Card would fill all the width available -> max-width (think it can be improved);
    - Tag:
        - Background would fill all width -> I was setting background to tags instead of tag items
    - Separator:
        - I didnt knew how to implement a separator -> empty div
        - Separator would not fill all width -> negative margin
